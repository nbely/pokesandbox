## Introduction

**What exactly is the PokeSandbox?**

- PokeSandbox is a node.js application that interfaces with the Discord API to provide custom responses to user-entered commands for server-owners to craft their own fan-game directly in Discord, and to then deploy their game to their server users to enjoy.

**What else does it do or will it do?**

- PokeSandbox includes a React-based web-application. This web application will allow for log-in using Discord Oauth account verification. There, users can use server discovery to see what servers/games are publically available to play. In addition, profile data for each of a user's characters on every server will be avaialble for viewing and updating.

- PokeSandobx interacts integrally with a customized Pokémon Showdown forked repository. For now, custom Pokemon, Types, Moves and Abilities need to be developed, reviewed, and approved for merging into the controlled Showdown Fork. Future plans would attempt to allow for these custom additions without direct code updates.

## Development

- The codebase is currently being refactored and carried in from the deprecated [Turq-Bot Repository][3]. Along with converting the project from JavaScript to TypeScript, additional plans to conver the application to a Next.JS application are in the works.
- For those interested in joining the development team, please see the link to the Discord server linked at the top of this README.
